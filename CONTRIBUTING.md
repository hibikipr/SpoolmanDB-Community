# Contributing to SpoolmanDB Community

Thanks for helping keep the filament database current!

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all types. Depending on your experience with Git and JSON, you can:
- **Report an Error or Suggest a New Filament:** If you are not comfortable writing JSON or using Git, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Icezaza2543/SpoolmanDB-Community/issues/new/choose) using one of our structured templates.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** If you can edit JSON directly, feel free to submit a PR with your changes.

## Data changes

- Add or edit manufacturer source files in `filaments/`.
- Keep manufacturer names, color names, weights, diameters, and temperatures aligned with manufacturer-published data when possible.
- Include source links in your pull request description for any new brand, new material, or data correction.
- Keep changes focused. Prefer one manufacturer or one related correction set per pull request.

## Validation

Run these checks before opening a pull request:

```bash
# Compile the individual filament files into filaments.json
python scripts/compile_filaments.py

# Validate all files and compiled outputs against schemas
python scripts/validate.py

# Run unit tests to verify compile functionality
python -m pytest

# Verify the complete output against Spoolman's current upstream model
python scripts/check_spoolman_compat.py

# Optional offline check against the reviewed contract used by normal CI builds
python scripts/check_spoolman_compat.py --upstream-file contracts/spoolman_externaldb.py
```

If requirements are missing, install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

The generated `filaments.json` should compile cleanly, and all schema, unit, and Spoolman compatibility checks must pass.

For refill products, use `"is_refill": true` in the relevant weight object and omit `spool_type`. The legacy source value `"spool_type": "refill"` is still accepted to avoid changing existing public IDs, but it is normalized to `spool_type: null` in the published database.

## Review expectations

Pull requests are reviewed for:

- valid JSON and schema compliance
- manufacturer/source evidence
- duplicate IDs or conflicting entries
- color naming and hex accuracy
- minimal unrelated formatting churn
